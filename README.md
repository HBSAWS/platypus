## Testing
Platypus is setup to use Selenium 2.5.3 for end-to-end testing. The standalone version of Selenium will be automatically downloaded and installed during the node package installation. 

#### Runnings tests:
```shell
gulp nightwatch:<<browser>> 
```
Available browsers: 'chrome', 'safari'*, 'ie'*

##### Safari Setup:
* Safari requires this [browser extension](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.48/)

##### IE Setup:
* Download the 32bit (not 64, [why?](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium-google-code-issue-archive/issues/5116)) driver [here](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.48/)
* Unzip and save the executable as ./node_modules/nightwatch/bin/IEDriverServer.exe

Then, open IE and set "Protected Mode" ON for all zones:
* Go to Tools > Internet Options > Security
* Set all zones (Internet, Local intranet, Trusted sites, Restricted sites) to the same protected mode, enabled or disabled should not matter.
* Finally, set Zoom level to 100% by right clicking on the gear located at the top right corner and enabling the status-bar. Default zoom level is now displayed at the lower right.
